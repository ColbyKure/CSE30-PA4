Description:
This program has two parts the first part, create, takes in at least 2 arguments
which are all used to create and populate the 3 tables. Then the program will
serialize the data onto a binary file, which is then used as the input to the
second part of the program, which deserializes the table and engages the user in
interative mode where the user may look up information about spam emails. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to compile:
Navigate to directory with the files for pa4. Then execute the make 
command and the Makefile in pa3 will run and will compile and link
all the required files, compiling create and search seperately
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to run:
./ followed by the name of the execuatable
Just type ./create or ./search followed by the correct arguments depending on
which program you want to run 

	./create -i [filename] -o [filename] [-s [size] -h]
	./search -i [filename] [-x [size] -h]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Normal output for create:
	./create -i emails/emails_100 -o write.txt -s 500
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Normal output for search:
	./search -i write.txt

horizontal@hack.co is SPAM!
Enter a word: asdf
asdf is SPAM!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abnormal output for search:
	./search -i asdf
Error opening table file for reading: No such file or directory

Usage: ./search -i inFile [-x] [-h]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------r
Abnormal output for create:
	./create -i asdf
Error opening input filter file: No such file or directory

Usage: ./create -i dataFile -o outFile [-s size] [-h]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Testing:
For testing the create portion I diffed the files for various table sizes and
used all of the given files in the emails/ directory to make sure that my
program worked for all sizes. Once I was done and satisfied with the create
portion I moved on to the search portion and did the smae things there. However,
I also had to test the error outputs for both so I tried to get the tester to
output as many of the errors that I could and compared the testers output to my
output.
